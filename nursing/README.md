# Nursing home analysis
You can load up the code in R-studio and run it and replicate my results.

Nobody has pointed out any bugs in the code.

You can also use excel to replicate my results.

See the data/analysis directory for the spreadsheet called 
"nursing_ALL with 12-27-20 reference.xlsx"

That's the file with the R output and commentary.
