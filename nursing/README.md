# Nursing home analysis
You can load up the code in R-studio and run it and replicate my results.

Nobody has pointed out any bugs in the code.

You can also use excel to replicate my results.

See the analysis directory for the spreadsheet called 
"nursing_ALL ..." That's the file with the R output and my commentary and excel plots.
