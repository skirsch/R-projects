# analyze CMS Nursing Home data

# to do
# compute for each provider the IFR for an 8 week window
# prior to the reference week vs. 8 weeks after the reference week
# to see if can find a provider where the IFR dropped by 3X or more
#
# compute first without reference ... just compute it the first time and then compute
# again so double compute
# replace poisson coefficients with gamma distribution
# state graphs need to use the state computed OR reference, not global ref.
#
# implement min_deaths
# calculate the OR reference using the new method

# Now have do QA on the tabs because
# when we did the lag(case,1) it means that can only compute extra stats
# on the week table, not on provider or state tables which we are clearly doing!
# so need to caculate those without a lag. Check that OR on those tabs is
# correctly computed from the reference OR!

# 8/31/23 everything works.

# 8/30/23: revised analysis with time lag worked perfectly.
# vaccine made things worse.
# OR nearly 2:1 on 2/28/01 *after* the case rates no longer falling
# so can't use rapidly falling case rates as "excuse" for high OR and IFR.
# We have 1. neutralized that with the time lag and 2. the peak happened when
# case rates had stabilized and 3. The OR stayed above 1 until 4/4/21!!!

# moving each week

# leave off the final value; it is computed so will sum to 1

# specify just two values. third is filled in automatically
# correlation is .996 with .2, .6, .2

# to do...
# add new global_summary() function like I asked chatgpt that extracts
# the "target row" of state db, plus some interesting columns as well, e.g., 4 weeks OR

# do a transform on the cases
# cases that lag by a preset amount (e.g., 3/7 of a weed)
# with a goal of minimizing the IFR peaks and valley
# this is easily done by doing a transform on the cases column
# where cases <- .2*cases + .8*lag(c) which shifts the cases to the future
# by a small amount
#
# check this in Excel and see if it makes an impact on the IFR curve before coding


# Data structure

# root is a hashtable with keys = states_to_process
# root is a global so easy to access from all functions
# root has the following keys:
#    ALL
#    CA
#    TX
#    ...

# Each state has a hash table with keys:
#   records: df of all the rows and the key columns
#   week: derived from the input
#   state: derivied
#   provider: derived
#   name: ALL or name of the state

# most functions will pipe the state hash table between the function calls, not the df
